#### A Console Application made with C#

## Technologies Used
* Git
* C#
* .NET6.0 Framework

## Description
_The Shape Tracker 1.0.0 App was made entirely with Javascript, in version 2.0.0 I am making use of the Language called C#. This is a major update to the Shape Tracker App. And as I said in version 1.0.0; This is not the end. Also for version 2.0.0(which is this version), I am sayng again; this is not the end.. Later on I would be joining both version 1.0.0(an app made with only frontend languages) with version 2.0.0(an app made with only backend languages) to produce a fully-fledged scalable Applicaton. More updates would be made on both versions: 1.0.0 and 2.0.0 along the line. Expect many more upgrades to the existing apps, I still plan on working with Xamarin to inculcate other features into this app, and along the line I might also use React too_
